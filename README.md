# CQ+ Training: Minimizing Accuracy Loss in Conversion from Convolutional Neural Networks to Spiking Neural Networks

## Installation
The repository includes C++ and CUDA code that has to be compiled and installed before it can be used from Python, download the repository and run the following command to do so:

`python setup.py install`

## Documentation
Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/zhoujuncc1/shenjingcat/wiki)

## Training Workflow
CQ Trainig is trained in stages as the figure shown in Figure5 in paper. The details of training methods is discussed in Section4.1.
