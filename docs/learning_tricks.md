We used a validation dataset consisting of 200 data points to select an appropriate time step $T$. Once we find a suitable $T$ that achieves high detection accuracy on this validation set, we use it for the entire testing dataset. Additionally, rather than training the original CNN from scratch when we change $T$, we only need one to three additional training iterations for the CNN to converge and attain a high baseline accuracy. For example, with a quantization level of 600, the VGG-$*$ CNN achieves a baseline accuracy of 95.15\% on CIFAR-10. Subsequently, switching to a time step of 100 and retraining the network for only two additional epochs results in a CNN accuracy of 95.14\%. We will describe these training tips in our training notes.
